## Course Description

This course focuses on using web-based tools on understanding ways in which curation can be used to shape narrative storytelling that influences our perception and consumption of narratives. Curation can be defined as “a action or process of selecting, analyzing, organizing, and sorting content in a collection and presenting in meaningful around a centralized theme.” Curation can be used to hold the narrative framework structure of a story together for listeners, viewers, or readers. By the use of web-based tools we can further examine the production, distribution, and consumption of these narratives towards an audience. The assignments throughout the course are structured to promote open-source digital resources, and help students broaden their understanding of curatorial work.

## Assignments

### Discussion Posts: 

### Storyboard: 
Storyboarding offers a way to visualize the relationship between objects and/or themes. You will take 10-20 images obtained from the open-source media platform of your choice (including Flickr, Wikimedia Commons, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian Institution, etc.) or you may use personal photographs or artwork. Think about the ways the objects relate to one another visually or thematically and organize across at least three pages. Create a title for your storyboards with a brief 50–200-word introduction. Additionally, a 250–500-word reflection on the process should note what you learned and how that informed the subjects/iconography you chose? Images can be organized digitally in the preferred platform of your choice (MS Publisher, Adobe, Google docs, etc.) or created by hand and scanned. Share what you’ve learned!

### Annotated Bibliography: 
You will develop an annotated bibliography exploring perspectives and theoretical debates that have been central to the field of visual media. There should be at least 5 annotations. They might include other topics more relevant to your own research. What are the key contributions of visual media literature to your larger field of inquiry? What models from these theoretical traditions have informed work in those fields? This bibliography is intended to get you familiar with the field and the academic discussions surrounding visual media, storytelling and narratives. It is also a starting point for your final project and should include a brief abstract of what you hope to explore through that project. 

### Digital Exhibition: 

You will create your own digital exhibition space using Scalar, a free, open source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. Using Scalar makes it easy for the user to publish content online. You will utilize Scalar as a platform to discuss your findings through a written post that MUST incorporate use of media formats to support your findings.
