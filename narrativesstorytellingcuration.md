### Storyboard: Storyboarding offers a way to visualize the relationship between objects and/or themes. In order to familiarize yourself with each other and the class, for this week’s assignment, you will be randomly assigned a classmate as a partner. Together you will develop a prototype exhibition using 10-25 images obtained from the open-source media platform of your choice. Think about the ways the object relates to one another visually or thematically, and organize three pages, representative of three gallery walls. Create a title for your exhibition and a brief 50-200 word introduction, and a reflection on the collaborative process – what did you and your partner learn about each other and how did that inform the subjects you choose?  Images can be organized digitally in the preferred platform of your choice (MS Publisher, Adobe, Google docs, etc.) or created by hand and scanned. Share what you’ve learned!

### Annotated Bibliography: You will develop an annotated bibliography exploring perspectives and theoretical debates that have been central to the field of visual media. There should be at least 5 annotations. They might include other topics more relevant to your own research. What are the key contributions of visual media literature to your larger field of inquiry? What models from these theoretical traditions have informed work in those fields? This bibliography is intended to get you familiar with the field and the academic discussions surrounding visual media, storytelling and narratives. It is also a starting point for your final project and should include a brief abstract of what you hope to explore through that project.
