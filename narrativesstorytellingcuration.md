## Course Description

This course focuses on understanding the ways in which curation can be used to shape storytelling and influence our perception and consumption of narratives. Curation is defined as “an action or process of selecting, analyzing, organizing, and sorting content in a collection and presenting it meaningfully around a centralized theme.” As an interpretive strategy, curation can be used to hold the narrative framework structure of a story together for listeners, viewers, or readers. Through the use of interdisciplinary methodologies and Web-based tools, we can further examine the production, distribution, and consumption of these narratives by diverse audiences. The assignments throughout this course are structured to promote open-source digital resources – particularly their capabilities for reconfiguration and customization – and help students broaden their understanding of curatorial practice and visual literacy. 

## Course Objectives

- Examine the impact of curatorial practice on a variety of visual media discourses including theories and debates in fan studies, art history, and game studies. 
- Identify current themes in fan studies and trace the growth of narrative in select visual media. 
- Familiarize students with Web-based open-source tools.
- Teach students effective methods for the discussion, organization, and presentation of their research.

## Assignments

### Discussion Posts: 

Each week (except those where a major assignment is due), you will answer a discussion question based off of the assigned readings. Your answers must be at least 200 words and should include a critical analysis of the text. When possible, you are encouraged to make connetions to any previous readings, experiences, as well as any research interests. 

### Storyboard: 
Storyboarding offers a way to visualize the relationship between objects and/or themes. You will take 10-20 images obtained from the open-source media platform of your choice (including Flickr, Wikimedia Commons, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian Institution, etc.) or you may use personal photographs or artwork. Think about the ways the objects relate to one another visually or thematically and organize across at least three pages. Create a title for your storyboards with a brief 50–200-word introduction. Additionally, a 250–500-word reflection on the process should note what you learned and how that informed the subjects/iconography you chose? Images can be organized digitally in the preferred platform of your choice (MS Publisher, Adobe, Google docs, etc.) or created by hand and scanned. Share what you’ve learned!

### Annotated Bibliography: 
You will develop an annotated bibliography exploring perspectives and theoretical debates that have been central to the field of visual media. There should be at least 5 annotations. They might include other topics more relevant to your own research. What are the key contributions of visual media literature to your larger field of inquiry? What models from these theoretical traditions have informed work in those fields? This bibliography is intended to get you familiar with the field and the academic discussions surrounding visual media, storytelling and narratives. It is also a starting point for your final project and should include a brief abstract of what you hope to explore through that project. 

### Digital Exhibition: 

You will create your own digital exhibition space using Scalar, a free, open source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. Using Scalar makes it easy for the user to publish content online. You will utilize Scalar as a platform to discuss your findings through a written post that MUST incorporate use of media formats to support your findings.

### Final Paper: 

You will write a paper related to the topics discussed over the course of the semester. Throughout the semester, we explored various theories related to visual media and art, as well as storytelling and narratives --your paper/project should continue a conversation the texts and we started during the semester. You should engage with issues and questions that arose through the texts and discussions in some specific way, using research and outside sources (a minimum of 5, at least 3 course texts referenced) to support your claims, argument(s), and/or assertions. While you are expected to use substantial sources, your voice and writing should still be primary. You are using sources to support your voice and content. The paper should be approximately 15 pages, double-spaced, and must closely and critically analyze and/or make a significant argument that addresses a question or issue arising from the materials from the course.
