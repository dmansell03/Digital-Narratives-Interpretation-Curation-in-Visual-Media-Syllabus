## Digital Exhibition

Using your storyboard assignment from week four as a prompt, you will create your own digital exhibition space with Scalar, a free, open-source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. You will utilize Scalar as a platform to discuss your findings through a written post that MUST incorporate use of media formats to support your findings. Include an introduction to the exhibition with a 250–350-word reflection. You do not have to use all of your storyboard imagery, but if the digital exhibition is a significant shift from the original storyboard, the reflection should explain why you chose to reconfigure or change the direction of your virtual presentation. What considerations did you have to make when adjusting your project to fit Scalar's framework?

Although some class time will be devoted to an introduction to Scalar, please reference the following tutorial page provided by the University of Illinois as an additional resource: https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=348220&p=2348685.
