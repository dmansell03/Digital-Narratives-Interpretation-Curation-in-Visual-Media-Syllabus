## Digital Exhibition

You will create your own digital exhibition space using Scalar, a free, open source authoring and publishing platform thatâ€™s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. Using Scalar makes it easy for the user to publish content online. You will utilize Scalar as a platform to discuss your findings through a written post that MUST incorporate use of media formats to support your findings. 

Although some class time will be devoted to an introduction to Scalar, please reference the following tutorial page provided by the University of Illinois as an additional resource: https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=348220&p=2348685.
