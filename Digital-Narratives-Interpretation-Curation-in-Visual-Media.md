# ENG 6820: Digital Narratives: Interpretation & Curation in Visual Media
- **Instructors:** Keidra Navaroli, Noemi Nunez, and Demagio Mansell 
- **Email:** knavaroli@knights.ucf.edu; noemin@knights.ucf.edu; dmansell03@knights.ucf.edu
- **Office Hours:** Zoom; Wednesdays 2:00 - 5:00 PM
- **Course Meeting:** Asynchronous Online

## Course Description

This course focuses on understanding the ways in which curation can be used to shape storytelling and influence our perception and consumption of digital narratives. Curation is defined as “an action or process of selecting, analyzing, organizing, and sorting content in a collection and presenting it meaningfully around a centralized theme.” As an interpretive strategy, curation can be used to hold the narrative framework structure of a story together for listeners, viewers, or readers. Through the use of interdisciplinary methodologies and Web-based tools, we will examine the production, distribution, and consumption of narratives by diverse audiences. The assignments throughout this course are structured to promote open-source digital resources – particularly their capabilities for reconfiguration and customization – and help students broaden their understanding of curatorial practice and visual literacy. 

## Course Objectives

- Examine the impact of curatorial practice on a variety of visual media discourses including theories and debates in fan studies, art history, and game studies. 
- Identify current themes in fan studies and trace the growth of narrative in select visual media. 
- Familiarize students with Web-based open-source tools.
- Teach students effective methods for the discussion, organization, and presentation of their research.


## Texts and Materials
This course will implement a variety of practical and theoretical texts. Most of the course materials are open-access or provided with access through UCF libraries, but excerpts from the following primary books will be included on the weeks in which they are assigned:

1) Kosnik, Abigail De. 2016. <i>Rogue Archives: Digital Cultural Memory and Media Fandom.</i> MIT Press.
2) Hatavara, Mari, Matti Hyvärinen, Maria Mäkelä, and Frans Mäyrä. 2015. <i>Narrative Theory, Literature, and New Media: Narrative Minds and Virtual Worlds.</i> Routledge.
3) Reilly, Maura. 2018. <i>Curatorial Activism: Towards an Ethics of Curating.</i> Thames & Hudson.


### Evaluation and Grading

| Points| Assignments Summary | 
|---|---|
| 80  | **Discussion Post** - Each week (except those where a major assignment is due), you will answer a discussion question based off of the assigned readings. Your answers must be at least 200 words and should include a critical analysis of the text. When possible, you are encouraged to make connetions to any previous readings, experiences, as well as any research interests. 
| 15  | **Storyboard** - Storyboarding offers a way to visualize the relationship between objects and/or themes. You will take 10-20 images obtained from the open-source media platform of your choice (including Flickr, Wikimedia Commons, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian Institution, etc.) or you may use personal photographs or artwork. Think about the ways the objects relate to one another visually or thematically and organize across at least three pages. Create a title for your storyboards with a brief 50–200-word introduction. Additionally, a 250–500-word reflection on the process should note what you learned and how that informed the subjects/iconography you chose? Images can be organized digitally in the preferred platform of your choice (MS Publisher, Adobe, Google docs, etc.) or created by hand and scanned. Share what you’ve learned!
| 50 | **Annotated Bibliography** - You will develop an annotated bibliography exploring perspectives and theoretical debates that have been central to the field of visual media. There should be at least 5 annotations. They might include other topics more relevant to your own research. What are the key contributions of visual media literature to your larger field of inquiry? What models from these theoretical traditions have informed work in those fields? This bibliography is intended to get you familiar with the field and the academic discussions surrounding visual media, storytelling and narratives. It is also a starting point for your final project and should include a brief abstract of what you hope to explore through that project. 
| 15 | **Digital Exhibition** - You will create your own digital exhibition space using Scalar, a free, open source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. 
| 50 | **Final Paper** - You will write a paper related to the topics discussed over the course of the semester. Throughout the semester, we explored various theories related to visual media and art, as well as storytelling and narratives --your final paper should continue a conversation with texts we started during the semester. You should engage with issues and questions that arose through the texts and discussions in some specific way, using research and outside sources (a minimum of 5, at least 3 course texts referenced) to support your claims, argument(s), and/or assertions. While you are expected to use substantial sources, your voice and writing should still be primary. You are using sources to support your voice and content. The paper should be approximately 15 pages, double-spaced, and must closely and critically analyze and/or make a significant argument that addresses a question or issue arising from the materials from the course.|

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

The Center of Academic Integrity (CAI) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/)

- **[UCF Creed](https://www.sdes.ucf.edu/creed/)**: Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF’s Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Land Acknowledgement Statement

The UCF Department of English acknowledges that our main campus stands on the traditional territories of the Seminole and Timucua peoples, and that other Native American traditional territories exist throughout Florida where our regional campuses are located. We collectively recognize their continuing connection to the land, water, and air and pay respect to their elders past, present, and emerging. We recognize the continuing consequences of colonialism on Indigenous peoples and their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and we fully endorse Indigenous Sovereignty.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf).
