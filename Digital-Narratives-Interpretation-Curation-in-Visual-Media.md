- **Instructors:** Keidra Navaroli, Noemi Nunez, and Demagio Mansell 
- **Email:** knavaroli@knights.ucf.edu; noemin@knights.ucf.edu; dmansell03@knights.ucf.edu

## Course Description

This course focuses on understanding the ways in which curation can be used to shape storytelling and influence our perception and consumption of digital narratives. Curation is defined as “an action or process of selecting, analyzing, organizing, and sorting content in a collection and presenting it meaningfully around a centralized theme.” As an interpretive strategy, curation can be used to hold the narrative framework structure of a story together for listeners, viewers, or readers. Through the use of interdisciplinary methodologies and Web-based tools, we will examine the production, distribution, and consumption of narratives by diverse audiences. The assignments throughout this course are structured to promote open-source digital resources – particularly their capabilities for reconfiguration and customization – and help students broaden their understanding of curatorial practice and visual literacy. 

## Course Objectives

- Examine the impact of curatorial practice on a variety of visual media discourses including theories and debates in fan studies, art history, and game studies. 
- Identify current themes in fan studies and trace the growth of narrative in select visual media. 
- Familiarize students with Web-based open-source tools.
- Teach students effective methods for the discussion, organization, and presentation of their research.


## Texts and Materials
This course will implement a variety of practical and theoretical texts. Most of the course materials are open-access or provided with access through UCF libraries, but excerpts from the following primary books will be included on the weeks in which they are assigned:

1) Howell, Katherine A. 2020. *Fandom, Now in Color: A Collection of Voices.* University of Iowa Press.
2) Kosnik, Abigail De. 2016. <i>Rogue Archives: Digital Cultural Memory and Media Fandom.</i> MIT Press.
3) Reilly, Maura. 2018. <i>Curatorial Activism: Towards an Ethics of Curating.</i> Thames & Hudson.


### Evaluation and Grading

| Points Breakdown| Assignments | 
|---|---|
| 80  | **Discussion Post** - Each week (except those where a major assignment is due), you will answer a discussion question based off of the assigned readings. Your answers must be at least 200 words and should include a critical analysis of the text. When possible, you are encouraged to make connections to any previous readings, experiences, as well as any research interests. 
| 15  | **Storyboard** - Storyboarding offers a way to visualize the relationship between objects and/or themes. You will take 10-20 images obtained from the open-source media platform of your choice (including Flickr, Wikimedia Commons, the Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access Collection, Smithsonian Open Access, etc.) or you may use personal photographs or artwork. Think about the ways the objects relate to one another visually or thematically and organize across at least three pages. Create a title for your storyboards with a brief 50–200-word introduction. Additionally, a 250–500-word reflection on the process should note what you learned and how that informed the subjects/iconography you chose? Images can be organized digitally in the preferred platform of your choice (MS Publisher, Adobe, Google docs, etc.) or created by hand and scanned. Share what you’ve learned!
| 50 | **Annotated Bibliography** - You will develop an annotated bibliography exploring perspectives and theoretical debates that have been central to the field of visual media. There should be at least 5 annotations. They might include other topics more relevant to your own research. What are the key contributions of visual media literature to your larger field of inquiry? What models from these theoretical traditions have informed work in those fields? This bibliography is intended to get you familiar with the field and the academic discussions surrounding visual media, storytelling and narratives. It is also a starting point for your final project and should include a brief abstract of what you hope to explore through that project. 
| 15 | **Digital Exhibition** - Using your storyboard assignment from week four as a prompt, you will create your own digital exhibition space with Scalar, a free, open-source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. You will utilize Scalar as a platform to discuss your findings through a written post that MUST incorporate use of media formats to support your findings. Include an introduction to the exhibition with a 250–350-word reflection. You do not have to use all of your storyboard imagery, but if the digital exhibition is a significant shift from the original storyboard, the reflection should explain why you chose to reconfigure or change the direction of your virtual presentation. What considerations did you have to make when adjusting your project to fit Scalar's framework?     
| 50 | **Final Paper** - You will write a paper related to the topics discussed over the course of the semester. Throughout the semester, we explored various theories related to visual media and art, as well as storytelling and narratives --your final paper should continue a conversation with texts we started during the semester. You should engage with issues and questions that arose through the texts and discussions in some specific way, using research and outside sources (a minimum of 5, at least 3 course texts referenced) to support your claims, argument(s), and/or assertions. While you are expected to use substantial sources, your voice and writing should still be primary. You are using sources to support your voice and content. The paper should be approximately 15 pages, double-spaced, and must closely and critically analyze and/or make a significant argument that addresses a question or issue arising from the materials from the course.|

## Assignments

### Discussion Posts: 

Each week (except those where a major assignment is due), you will answer a discussion question based off of the assigned readings. Your answers must be at least 200 words and should include a critical analysis of the text. When possible, you are encouraged to make connections to any previous readings and experiences, as well as any research interests. 

### Storyboard: 
Storyboarding offers a way to visualize the relationship between objects and/or themes. You will take 10-20 images obtained from the open-source media platform of your choice (including Flickr, Wikimedia Commons, the Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access Collection, Smithsonian Open Access, etc.) or you may use personal photographs or artwork. Think about the ways the objects relate to one another visually or thematically and organize them across at least three pages. Create a title for your storyboards with a brief 50–200-word introduction. Additionally, a 250–500-word reflection on the process should note what you learned and how that informed the subjects/iconography you chose? Images can be organized digitally in the preferred platform of your choice (MS Publisher, Adobe, Google docs, etc.) or created by hand and scanned. Share what you’ve learned!

### Annotated Bibliography: 
You will develop an annotated bibliography exploring perspectives and theoretical debates that have been central to the field of visual media. There should be at least 5 annotations. They might include other topics more relevant to your own research. What are the key contributions of visual media literature to your larger field of inquiry? What models from these theoretical traditions have informed work in those fields? This bibliography is intended to get you familiar with the field and the academic discussions surrounding visual media, storytelling and narratives. It is also a starting point for your final project and should include a brief abstract of what you hope to explore through that project. 

### Digital Exhibition: 

Using your storyboard assignment from week four as a prompt, you will create your own digital exhibition space with Scalar, a free, open-source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. You will choose a specific story world and provide your audience with a visual and textual representation of your interpretation and narrative. You will utilize Scalar as a platform to discuss your findings through a written post that MUST incorporate use of media formats to support your findings. Include an introduction to the exhibition with a 250–350-word reflection. You do not have to use all of your storyboard imagery, but if the digital exhibition is a significant shift from the original storyboard, the reflection should explain why you chose to reconfigure or change the direction of your virtual presentation. What considerations did you have to make when adjusting your project to fit Scalar's framework?   

Although some class time will be devoted to an introduction to Scalar, please reference the following tutorial page provided by the University of Illinois as an additional resource: https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=348220&p=2348685. 

### Final Paper: 

You will write a paper related to the topics discussed over the course of the semester. Throughout the semester, we explored various theories related to visual media and art, as well as storytelling and narratives, so your final paper should continue a conversation with texts we started during the semester. You should engage with issues and questions that arose through the texts and discussions in some specific way, using research and outside sources (a minimum of 5, at least 3 course texts referenced) to support your claims, argument(s), and/or assertions. While you are expected to use substantial sources, your voice and writing should still be primary. You are using sources to support your voice and content. The paper should be approximately 15 pages, double-spaced, and must closely and critically analyze and/or make a significant argument that addresses a question or issue arising from the materials from the course.

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

The Center of Academic Integrity (CAI) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/)

- **[UCF Creed](https://www.sdes.ucf.edu/creed/)**: Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should review and familiarize themselves with the Academic Misconduct section in [UCF’s Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). 

###  Plagiarism

Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Plagiarism or cheating of any form will automatically result in a "F" for the assignment and may result in a "F" or a "Z" designator  for the course grade. Students should review the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members must uphold the responsibility of students' education and must report any academic misconduct that takes place. All Academic Misconduct will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Once reported, academic misconduct can lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or suspension or separation from the University.

### Course Accessibility Statement

University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- Please consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk) about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere.

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

If students who are deployed active duty military and require special accommodation due to your status should contact your instructor to discuss further the circumstances.

## COVID-19

UCF expects everyone to protect our campus community by getting vaccinated if able to, and wear facial covering indoors, in line with the latest CDC guidelines.  

If the instructor falls ill during the semester, there may be temporary changes to this course, including having a backup instructor take over the course or going remote for a short time. Please look for announcements or mail in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email for any temporary alterations to this course. 
 
Students who believe they may have been exposed to COVID-19 or who test positive must contact UCF Student Health Services (407-823-2509) so proper contact tracing procedures can take place. Students should not come to campus if they are ill, are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or have tested positive for COVID-19. 
 
Students should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible if they miss class for any illness to discuss reasonable adjustments that might need to be made. When possible, students should contact their instructor(s) before missing class
